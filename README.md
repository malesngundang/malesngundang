## Males Ngundang

### Hi there âœ¨

We are Males Ngundang, we aim to create an open source software for you to create a digital invitation for your wedding (We started from that!)

The goal for this software is for you who are lazy/busy creating an invitation.

This software is a free software, we use Supabase, Next.js and keep all the data there.

As long as Supabase is free, we can use it to provide the top tier digital invitation with an easy to modify

We also open for any suggestion
